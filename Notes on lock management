Safe alternatives to typing the password every time
1) Enable fingerprint authentication (PAM)

Let PAM accept a fingerprint so Sway / swaylock will authenticate via the fingerprint reader.

Debian / Ubuntu (example)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install fprintd libpam-fprintd
# enroll fingerprint (run as your user)
fprintd-enroll


Edit PAM for sway (or systemwide). If your system uses /etc/pam.d/sway create it or edit /etc/pam.d/common-auth and add near the top:

auth    sufficient    pam_fprintd.so


Reload your session or log out/in. swaylock uses PAM, so enrolled fingerprints will unlock it.

Arch Linux (example)
sudo pacman -S fprintd libfprint
# enroll:
fprintd-enroll


Same PAM change as above.

Pros: convenient, relatively fast.
Cons: biometric authentication has different security properties (cannot be "changed"); ensure you understand local risks.

2) Use a hardware token (YubiKey / FIDO2) with PAM (strong + convenient)

Use a YubiKey / FIDO2 token to unlock via pam_u2f or pam_fido2.

Typical steps (packages vary by distro)

Install pam-u2f or libpam-fido2 / pamu2fcfg packages.

Register your key for your user (example for pamu2fcfg / pam-u2f):

# create mapping for the user (run as your user)
pamu2fcfg > ~/.config/Yubico/u2f_keys
# or follow pam-u2f setup to put keys into /etc/u2f_keys or similar


Add to PAM (e.g. /etc/pam.d/sway):

auth    sufficient    pam_u2f.so


or for libpam-fido2:

auth    sufficient    pam_fido2.so


Pros: strong, fast, phishing-resistant.
Cons: requires hardware token and careful setup; lose token = need recovery plan.
